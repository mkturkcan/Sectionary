# Sectionary

A powerful toolkit for processing creative writing content to build high-quality training datasets for Large Language Models (LLMs), with a focus on improving creative writing capabilities through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

## Overview

Traditional LLM outputs often suffer from overly structured and formulaic writing patterns. Sectionary helps create better training data by breaking down existing literary works (in .epub format) into meaningful chunks, generating high-quality summaries and analyses, and preparing data for DPO training to reduce common LLM writing artifacts.
